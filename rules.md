# X-Team 109 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will first attempt to break the project into modular tasks that can be delegated out to each member.

We will then enter into a discussion to determine who will work on which tasks. We will also set due dates for each milestone or task that needs to be accomplished.

In the case that our original plan has to be scrapped or goes through a non-insignificant change, we will re-discuss the attack plan for our project and re-delegate work accordingly. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will follow up with one another via email or in-person meetings (depending on the type of work being done). This will be our means to holding one another accountable for having work done on time.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will first consult our most immediate resources, each other, to see if our own team members may know the solution or be able to help solve the difficulties we run into.

If that does not suffice, we will consult either a TA or the professor, and share our gatherings with the rest of the team.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

In our group of 4, each person will be responsible for following up with one other team member. Every member will be checked up on by one other person essentially and any issues with meeting deadlines will be communicated with the rest of the group. This way we also reduce redundancies that would occur if one person had to follow up with every other member.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

- Over-communicating is better than under-communicating
- Do not be afraid to ask for help or to express your thoughts
- Be respectful of one another
- Conflicts should be handled peacefully, seek the guidance of other team members, do not isolate yourself with the other party in the conflict
